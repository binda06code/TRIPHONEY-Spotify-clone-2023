Music 1
Music 2
Music 3
2.5.2Output Information of the System:
-Plays the songs
2.5.3Functional / Processing of the System:
• Processing Requirement:
–Requires the Internet connection in the system.
–Needs the browser to start the music player.
3System Planning
3.1Survey of Technology
3.1.1HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
HTML serves as the standard markup language for web documents, designed to be displayed in HTML serves as the fundamental markup language for web documents, tailored for display in web browsers. Its semantic structuring complements Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages like JavaScript. HTML elements act as the building blocks of web pages, defining structure and embedding multimedia elements. Tags such as <head>, <body>, and <input /> introduce content and structure. CSS is employed for styling and layout.
3.1.2CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a critical style sheet language for describing web document presentation, particularly in HTML-marked documents. It facilitates the separation of content and presentation, granting control over layout, colors, and fonts. By specifying CSS in a separate file, presentation characteristics can be shared across multiple web pages, ensuring consistency and reducing redundancy. CSS allows content adaptation for various rendering methods, such as on-screen, print, or mobile devices. The cascading priority scheme in CSS ensures predictable styling rules, and its specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
 3.1.3. .JavaScript
JavaScript, commonly embedded in HTML, enriches the behavior and interactivity of web pages. It enables dynamic content creation, user interface modifications, and asynchronous communication with servers. JavaScript is integral to modern web development, empowering developers to construct responsive and interactive web applications. Its versatility serves as a potent tool for client-side scripting, complementing HTML and CSS to craft engaging user experiences.
4Implementation Details
4.1Front-end Development
The front-end development serves as the cornerstone of our project, heavily relying on HTML, CSS, and JS to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Drawing inspiration from design principles seen in platforms like Spotify, our front-end prioritizes an intuitive navigation system, visually appealing layout, and accessibility considerations. We intentionally avoid the integration of React.js to maintain a lightweight and straightforward front-end, ensuring optimal performance.
4.2Back-end Development
The back-end of the system ensures the seamless integration of two core features: music playback and user authentication. The simplicity of the back-end aligns with the core technologies—HTML, CSS, and JS—used for the website.
4.3Music Upload Feature
Within the back-end, a key feature is the implementation of music playback functionality. This involves creating endpoints for handling music play requests and ensuring a smooth playback experience for users. Additionally, the back-end incorporates a user authentication system for personalized interactions. While the back-end is intentionally kept minimal, the front-end empowers users with an enhanced experience resembling popular music streaming platforms like Spotify.
4.4Progress till Date and The Remaining Work
The project has made significant progress in front-end development, achieving a user-friendly interface with components such as the homepage, search bar, and playlist display. Backend development is underway, with the user authentication system partially implemented. The music upload feature is in progress, with challenges related to file handling and storage being actively addressed.
Remaining work includes refining backend functionalities, completing the music upload feature, implementing user-specific playlists, conducting thorough testing, and preparing for deployment.
4.5Limitations and Future Directions
The current website, built with HTML, CSS, and JS, has a Spotify-like frontend but faces scalability challenges. The backend, offering basic music playback and user authentication, lacks advanced features and may pose security concerns. Future improvements include expanding backend functionalities, integrating third-party APIs, ensuring responsive design, enhancing user engagement, exploring monetization strategies, and optimizing performance. These steps aim to transform the platform into a more dynamic, secure, and feature-rich music streaming experience.
